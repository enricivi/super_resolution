# super-resolution
Super-resolution (SR) is a technique that constructs an high-resolution image from several observed low-resolution images.
The basic idea behind SR is to combine the non-redundant information contained in multiple low-resolution frames.

Methods implemented on matlab with [emmeenne93](https://github.com/emmeenne93):

	1. Authors: M. Elad, Y. Hel-Or
	   Paper: A Fast Super-Resolution Reconstruction Algorithm for Pure Translation Motion and Common Space-Invariant Blur
	   
	2. Authors: S. Farsiu, M. Dirk Robinson, M. Elad, P. Milanfar
	   Paper: Fast and Robust Multiframe Super Resolution
The two papers can be found clicking on [Elad and Hel-Or](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/935034/) or [Milanfar et al.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1246674/)

### Run SR.m inside the folder to test the script on "text-test" images.

#### Note that on Milanfar implementation parameters have to be chosen in order to obtain the best result.
