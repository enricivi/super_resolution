# super-resolution
Super-resolution (SR) is a technique that constructs an high-resolution image from several observed low-resolution images.
The basic idea behind SR is to combine the non-redundant information contained in multiple low-resolution frame.

Methods implemented on matlab with Matteo Nesti (m.nesti@gmail.com):
